# korg-volca-teensy-filter
Sketch for a MIDI filter to drive Korg Volcas. Fixes the channels problem for Volca Sample and allows Volca FM to receive volume data.

The plan is to package this into a nice hardware box, implementing 3 MIDI ins and 5 MIDI outs. (TODO will upload schematic). Will be using a Teensy LC to host this firmware, using the 3 hardware serial lines.
